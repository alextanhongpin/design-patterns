# Design Patterns

#### 6 things you need to know about design pattern.

1. There are 3 categories of design pattern - creational patterns, structural patterns and behavioral patterns.
2. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is not a design pattern.
3. One of the most comprehensive book on design pattern is `Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software` written by the so-called "Gang of Four".
4. Design patterns can be combined to form super-patterns.
5. Frameworks are not design patterns, but they do implement design patterns.
6. The opposite of design pattern is anti-pattern.

## Others
- design patterns is not to instruct you how to build software, but rather to give guidance on ways in which to solve common problems
- design patterns provide hints on how to solve common problem

## Three Major Groups

- __Creational__: outline a number of ways in which objects could be created and their lifecycles managed
- __Behavioral__: describe how objects interact with each other
- __Structural__: describes a variety of different ways to add functionality to existing objects

## Anti-Patterns

- __The Blob__, a.k.a __god object__, is a pattern in which one object grows to take on the responsibility for vast swaths of the application logic.
- __Lava Flow__ is a pattern that emerges as project ages and nobody knows if code is still in used.
